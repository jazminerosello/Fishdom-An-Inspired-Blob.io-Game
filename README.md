**Program Description**:

  A minigame that was implemented using Java. It was inspired by the blob.io game. 
  Fishdom is a game where the goal is for the player(guardian) to eat as many foods and enemies as he can while avoiding bigger enemies that can eat him. When a guardian is created, 
it is given initially a score of 0 foods and enemies eaten. The guardian can move up, left, right, or down. There are 50 foods in the map where both the player and enemy can 
consume to get bigger. Enemies move at random directions and die when the bigger player or co-enemy eats him. When the player eats a smaller enemy, the player's size increases,
However, when the player tries to eat a bigger enemy, the player dies. Time is also recorded as long as the guardian is still alive.


Different power-ups can be collected by the guardian:
  Item 			                Effect
Speedboost	    doubles the speed of for 5 seconds
Shield 	 		    provides immunity for 5 seconds

You can play this game with your friend. Beat his/her time being alive and the number of food eaten. Enjoy!
